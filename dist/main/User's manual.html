<h1>The story</h1>
<p>Stevedore works at the docks, loading and unloading ships in a small coastal town.</p>
<p>He is in love with the beautiful lighthouse keeper.</p>
<p>Today is the annual summer party, and Stevedore is hurrying up to finish the job and go to the party with her.</p>
<p align="center">
	Suddenly&hellip;<br>
	the floor cracks under his feet&hellip;</p>
<p>Help Stevedore find the keys to get out of the abandoned warehouse. The lighthouse keeper is waiting for him at the lighthouse.</p>
<p align="center">
	Or isn't she?<br>
	What other adventures might happen!?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>
	Good luck, Stevedore!</strong></p>

<p>If an enemy touches Stevedore, if Stevedore walks onto spikes, or if Stevedore falls into the water, you will lose one life.</p>
<p>The game ends when all lives are lost.</p>

<p>If you can no longer proceed in the game as the result of mistakes you have made in play, press the <kbd>STOP</kbd> key. This will start you once again at the beginning of the same room in which you stopped. You will lose one life by doing this, however.</p>

<h1>Hints</h1>

<p>You can get some items by passing directly in front of them:</p>
<table><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-key.png" /></td>
	<td>The keys will unlock the door to the next room.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-fruits.png" /></td>
	<td>Grandma says the fruits are good for the memory (and delicious too!)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-star.png" /></td>
	<td>These little stars are quite rare, and nobody knows for sure what they are for.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>There are several animals that live around the abandoned warehouse. Each animal has a characteristic type of movement. Figure out as quickly as you can how to avoid them!</p>
<table><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-bat.png" /></td>
	<td>The bats simply fly around. Grandma dislikes them for no apparent reason.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-spider.png" /></td>
	<td>The spiders hide quietly in the dark. But they won't miss any opportunity to bite someone.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-snake.png" /></td>
	<td>The snakes wander around aimlessly, getting in everyone's way.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-jellyfish.png" /></td>
	<td></p>Jellyfishes are armed with stinging tentacles. Fortunately, they live under water&hellip;</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-urchin.png" /></td>
	<td>Sea urchins don't move too much, but can push themselves with their spines. on't get too close to them!</p></td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-pantojo.png" /></td>
	<td>Grandma used to tell stories about the beligerant tribe of Pantojos&hellip; but it's been a long time since the last Pantojo was seen ashore in Stevedore's town.<br>Nowadays, nobody remembers where their island is.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>And, as grandma says, "think before you act". There is no time limit, so carefully plan your movements in advance. Otherwise, you are likely to get stuck.</p>

<h1>Cautions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use only with home computers bearing the MSX mark.</li>
<li>Be sure that your computer is turned off when inserting and removing the cartridge.</li>
<li>Do not touch slot connections.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to open or disassemble the cartridge.</li>
<li>Avoid extreme temperatures, humidity, and impacts.</li>
</ul>
