# How to play

This game is designed to be played by one person with either the keyboard or a joystick.

Press space key or the trigger on the joystick to start the game.

You control the actions of Stevedore. At the beginning of the game you have five lives.

In order to procees, you must get the key and enter the exit door of each room.

You can get a key by passing directly in front of it. If you get the key, the door to the next room will open.

If an enemy touches Stevedore, if Stevedore walks onto spikes, or if Stevedore falls into the water, you will lose one life.

The game ends when all lives are lost.

If you can no longer proceed in the game as the result of mistakes you have made in play, press the STOP key. This will start you once again at the beginning of the same room in which you stopped. You will lose one life by doing this, however.

# Hints

You can get some items by passing directly in front of them:

<table><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-key.png" /></td>
	<td>The keys will unlock the door to the next room.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-fruits.png" /></td>
	<td>Grandma says the fruits are good for the memory (and delicious too!)</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-star.png" /></td>
	<td>These little stars are quite rare, and nobody knows for sure what they are for.</td>
</tr></table>

<br>
There are several animals that live around the abandoned warehouse. Each animal has a characteristic type of movement. Figure out as quickly as you can how to avoid them!

<table><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-bat.png" /></td>
	<td>The bats simply fly around. Grandma dislikes them for no apparent reason.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-spider.png" /></td>
	<td>The spiders hide quietly in the dark. But they won't miss any opportunity to bite someone.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-snake.png" /></td>
	<td>The snakes wander around aimlessly, getting in everyone's way.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-jellyfish.png" /></td>
	<td></p>Jellyfishes are armed with stinging tentacles. Fortunately, they live under water&hellip;</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-urchin.png" /></td>
	<td>Sea urchins don't move too much, but can push themselves with their spines. on't get too close to them!</p></td>
</tr><tr>
	<td><img src="images/sticker-pantojo.png" /></td>
	<td>Grandma used to tell stories about the beligerant tribe of Pantojos&hellip; but it's been a long time since the last Pantojo was seen ashore in Stevedore's town.<br>Nowadays, nobody remembers where their island is.</td>
</tr></table>

<br>
And, as grandma says, "think before you act". There is no time limit, so carefully plan your movements in advance. Otherwise, you are likely to get stuck.
